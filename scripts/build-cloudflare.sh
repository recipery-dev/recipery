# Next.js auto-loads .env during every `next build` and inlines whatever it
# finds into the compiled output — including secrets that have nothing to do
# with Cloudflare (S3_ACCESS_KEY, SMTP passwords, etc. from a developer's
# local self-hosted setup). Rather than maintaining a list of vars to blank
# out (easy to miss one — that's exactly how a real key got leaked once),
# .env is hidden from Next entirely for the duration of this build.
set -e

# A prior run that got killed (SIGKILL can't be trapped) can strand .env
# under this name — put it back before doing anything else.
